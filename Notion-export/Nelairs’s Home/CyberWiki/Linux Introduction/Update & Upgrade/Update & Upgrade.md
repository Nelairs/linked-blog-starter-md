Being superuser, if you want to update packages youâ€™ll use

`$~ apt update`

In this case, there 100 packages that can be upgraded

  

If using Parrot OS (like in this case) you should never do `apt upgrade` because this would corrupt the system

In parrot you use `parrot-upgrade`

And it will proceed to upgrade every package
