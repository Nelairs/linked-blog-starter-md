So what is capabilities? Letâ€™s see an example with the Python3.9 binary

![[Untitled 551.png|Untitled 551.png]]

As I can see the binary belongs to user and group **root,** but there is not SUID neither SGID asigned

So if I enter an interactive terminal and try to change my user ID and become root I should not be able to.

![[Untitled 1 17.png|Untitled 1 17.png]]

Well as seen, I became root

![[Untitled 2 14.png|Untitled 2 14.png]]

Why is that? How is possible? Well there is a tool that can help

![[Untitled 3 14.png|Untitled 3 14.png]]

getcap is for listing capabilities of the system

So if we list from the system root directory we have this output

Here is something interesting, in the python3.9 binary, there is a capability called **cap_seuid=ep** this tells me that is posible to change or set the User ID, so that is why we can become **ROOT.  
  
  
**Now this is not set by default, in this case was set for the PoC

Now there is a resource that is well used in Pentesting, this is GTFOBins that list binaries and its vulnerabilities and exploits for Unix systems.

On a counterpart there is LOLBAS which is the same but with windows binaries.

For example, in Python, if there is a Capabilitie, lets look what we can do

Now here, in a one liner we have a PrivEsc

This will spawn a shell as root
